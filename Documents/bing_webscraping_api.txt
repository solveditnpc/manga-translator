the bing api provides uncesored text, and leaves it to the developer to filter out any unwanted content
on the other hand web scraping bing translator - it gives out censore words for eg 
"what the f**k"  # partial for certain words 
"what the"       # more profound words are removed 
"what the ****"  # sometimes it chooses complete censorship
which is a problem for the web scrapers
